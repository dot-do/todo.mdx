## What is claude.mdx?

**MDX components that render live data to markdown — realtime context for humans AND AI.**

The core insight: README, TODO, ROADMAP, and AI instructions (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules) are all views of the same data. Define once in MDX, render everywhere.

## Quick Start

Install claude.mdx in your project:

```bash
npm install claude.mdx
```

## How It Works

Create a `TODO.mdx` file with live data components:

```mdx
# TODO

## Ready to Work
<Issues.Ready limit={3} />

## In Progress
<Issues.InProgress />

## Blocked
<Issues.Blocked />
```

The MDX gets compiled to markdown showing the actual data:

```markdown
# TODO

## Ready to Work
- [ ] **todo-4fh** [P1]: Create cli.mdx package
- [ ] **todo-8mg** [P1]: Export Payload via Workers RPC
- [ ] **todo-3y0** [P1]: Add shadcn dashboard to Payload app

## In Progress
- [ ] **todo-2ab** [P2]: Implement MCP server

## Blocked
_No blocked issues_
```

## Key Features

- **Live Data**: Components pull from beads, GitHub Issues, or Payload CMS
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Changes flow between `.todo/*.md`, GitHub, and local beads
- **AI-Ready**: Markdown output is perfect context for Claude, Cursor, and other AI tools
- **Developer-Friendly**: Write once in MDX, render to multiple formats

## Components

### Issues Components

- `<Issues.Ready />` - Show unblocked tasks ready to work
- `<Issues.InProgress />` - Show tasks currently being worked on
- `<Issues.Blocked />` - Show blocked tasks with blockers
- `<Issues.List />` - Show all issues with filters

### Roadmap Components

- `<Roadmap.Epics />` - Show high-level epics
- `<Roadmap.Timeline />` - Show timeline view
- `<Roadmap.Dependencies />` - Show dependency graph

## Architecture

```
beads (.beads/) ←→ claude.mdx API ←→ GitHub Issues
       ↓                ↓
   TODO.mdx         Payload CMS
       ↓                ↓
   TODO.md          Dashboard
```
