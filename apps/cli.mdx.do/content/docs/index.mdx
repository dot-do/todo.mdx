# cli.mdx

**Build beautiful CLIs with MDX components powered by Bun and React.**

cli.mdx is a framework for creating interactive command-line interfaces using the same MDX components you use for documentation. Write your CLI once in MDX, and render it beautifully in the terminal.

## Features

- **MDX Components** - Use React components in your CLI
- **Type-Safe** - Full TypeScript support
- **Fast** - Powered by Bun runtime
- **Beautiful** - Rich terminal rendering with colors and layout
- **Reusable** - Share components between docs and CLI

## Installation

```bash
bun add cli.mdx
```

## Quick Start

Create a `cli.mdx` file:

```mdx
import { Command, Flag, Arg } from 'cli.mdx'

<Command name="hello" description="Say hello">
  <Arg name="name" description="Your name" required />
  <Flag name="--greeting" alias="-g" description="Custom greeting" />
</Command>

export function run({ name, greeting = 'Hello' }) {
  return `${greeting}, ${name}!`
}
```

Run it:

```bash
bun cli.mdx hello World
# Output: Hello, World!

bun cli.mdx hello World --greeting "Howdy"
# Output: Howdy, World!
```

## Why cli.mdx?

Traditional CLI frameworks require you to define your interface in code, then write separate documentation. With cli.mdx:

1. **Write once** - Your MDX components define both the interface AND documentation
2. **Stay in sync** - Docs can never be out of sync with your CLI
3. **Rich formatting** - Use the full power of MDX for help text and output
4. **Type safety** - TypeScript ensures your CLI is correct
