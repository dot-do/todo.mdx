# Core Concepts

Learn the fundamental concepts that power agents.mdx.

## Agents

An agent is a self-contained unit that:
- Has a specific purpose or role
- Accesses context from various sources
- Follows defined workflows
- Interacts with users or systems

Agents are defined using MDX, combining markdown documentation with executable code.

## Context

Context is the knowledge and information an agent uses to make decisions:

- **Code Context**: Understanding your codebase structure and patterns
- **Documentation Context**: Reference materials and guides
- **Runtime Context**: Real-time data from APIs or databases
- **Conversation Context**: History of interactions

## Workflows

Workflows define the sequence of steps an agent follows:

```mdx
<Agent.Workflow>
  <Step name="gather">Collect necessary information</Step>
  <Step name="analyze">Process and analyze data</Step>
  <Step name="decide">Make decisions based on analysis</Step>
  <Step name="act">Execute the chosen action</Step>
</Agent.Workflow>
```

## Components

agents.mdx provides React components for building agent interfaces:

- `<Agent.Context>` - Define context sources
- `<Agent.Workflow>` - Define workflow steps
- `<Agent.Action>` - Define agent actions
- `<Agent.UI>` - Build custom interfaces

## Integration

Agents can integrate with:
- Version control systems (Git, GitHub)
- Issue trackers (beads, GitHub Issues)
- CI/CD pipelines
- Communication tools (Slack, Discord)
- Custom APIs and services
