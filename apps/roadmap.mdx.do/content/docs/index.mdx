description: Get started with roadmap.mdx - MDX-powered roadmap rendering with live data
---

## What is roadmap.mdx?

**roadmap.mdx** is a package that lets you define roadmaps in MDX and render them to markdown with live data from your issue tracking system.

Instead of maintaining static roadmap files that get out of date, you write MDX components that pull real-time data:

```mdx
## Q1 2025 Roadmap

<Roadmap.Quarter quarter="2025-Q1">
  <Roadmap.Epic epic="EPIC-123" />
  <Roadmap.Epic epic="EPIC-456" />
</Roadmap.Quarter>
```

This renders to markdown showing current progress, blockers, and completion status.

## Key Features

- **Live Data**: Roadmaps stay current with your issue tracker
- **MDX Components**: Write roadmaps as code with type safety
- **Multiple Formats**: Render to markdown, HTML, or custom formats
- **Issue Integration**: Works with GitHub Issues, beads, and other trackers

## Architecture

roadmap.mdx integrates with the todo.mdx ecosystem:

- **MDX Source**: Define roadmaps in `ROADMAP.mdx`
- **Compiler**: Renders MDX to markdown at build time or on demand
- **Data Sources**: Pulls from beads, GitHub Issues, or Payload CMS
- **Output**: Static markdown files or API responses

## Getting Started

Install the package:

```bash
pnpm add roadmap.mdx
```

Create a `ROADMAP.mdx` file:

```mdx
# 2025 Product Roadmap

<Roadmap.Year year="2025">
  <Roadmap.Quarter quarter="Q1">
    <Roadmap.Epic epic="EPIC-123" />
  </Roadmap.Quarter>
</Roadmap.Year>
```

Compile to markdown:

```bash
roadmap compile ROADMAP.mdx -o ROADMAP.md
```
