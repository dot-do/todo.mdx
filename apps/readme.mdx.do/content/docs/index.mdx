---

## What is readme.mdx?

**readme.mdx** is a collection of MDX components that turn your README into a living document. Write once in MDX, render to markdown with live data - perfect for both humans and AI agents.

The core insight: README files should be dynamic. With readme.mdx, your documentation stays in sync with your actual codebase, issues, and project state.

## Features

- **Live Data**: Components that render real-time information from your project
- **Markdown Output**: Generates clean markdown that works everywhere
- **AI-Friendly**: Perfect for AI agents that need current project context
- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support
- **Extensible**: Easy to create custom components

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install readme.mdx
```

Create a `README.mdx` file:

```mdx
# My Project

<Issues.Ready limit={3} />

## Stats
<Project.Stats />
```

Compile to markdown:

```bash
npx readme.mdx compile README.mdx
```

## Use Cases

- **Project Documentation**: Keep README in sync with actual project state
- **AI Context**: Provide AI agents with current task lists
- **Team Coordination**: Show what's ready to work on
- **Onboarding**: Dynamic documentation that's always up-to-date
