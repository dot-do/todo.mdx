# Add sandbox performance and load tests

No performance testing exists for the sandbox:
- Concurrent session limits
- Cold start time measurements
- Resource consumption benchmarks
- Memory leak detection
- Container cleanup verification
- Streaming buffer limits for large output

Need load testing infrastructure and baseline metrics.
