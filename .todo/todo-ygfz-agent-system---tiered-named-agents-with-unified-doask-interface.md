# Agent System - Tiered named agents with unified do/ask interface

Implement tiered agent system where named agents (Priya, Reed, Dana, Fiona) are assigned to issues. Each agent has specific tools, an execution tier (light/worker/sandbox), and dynamically resolved model preferences (best/fast/cheap/overall).

See design: docs/plans/2025-12-21-agent-system-design.md
