# Cloud sync for agent configurations

Sync agent definitions between repo and cloud:
- Push agents.mdx changes to todo.mdx.do on git push
- Merge with pre-built cloud agents
- Store runtime state (active sessions, capacity) in cloud
- Dashboard shows agent status but repo config is source of truth
