# Phase 1: Wire Core Autonomy Loop

Make the autonomy loop work end-to-end: Issue ready → Agent spawns → PR created → Merged → Dependents unblock.

This is the critical path to fully autonomous software development. Everything else builds on this working.

## Success Criteria
- Close a blocking issue → dependent issue gets implemented automatically
- DevelopWorkflow creates real PRs with Claude's code
- Merge triggers dependent issue processing
