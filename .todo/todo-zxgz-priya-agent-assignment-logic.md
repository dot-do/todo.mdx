# Priya: Agent assignment logic

Implement Priya's assignment algorithm:
1. Get ready issues from DAG
2. For each issue, find best-fit agent (capabilities, focus area)
3. Assign: bd update <id> --assignee=<agent>
4. Assignment triggers DevelopWorkflow (via agents.mdx trigger)

No artificial capacity limits - DAG structure is the natural throttle.
