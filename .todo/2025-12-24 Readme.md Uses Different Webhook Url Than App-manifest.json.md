# README.md uses different webhook URL than app-manifest.json

The README.md documents a different hosted service URL than what's in the app-manifest.json:

**README.md line 234:**
```
Point your GitHub App webhook to `https://todo.mdx.workers.dev/webhook`
```

**app-manifest.json:**
```
"hook_attributes": {
  "url": "https://todo.mdx.do/api/webhooks/github"
}
```

These appear to be two different services:
1. `todo.mdx.workers.dev` - Cloudflare Workers subdomain
2. `todo.mdx.do` - Custom domain

The documentation should clarify which is the correct endpoint, or explain that both may exist for different purposes.
