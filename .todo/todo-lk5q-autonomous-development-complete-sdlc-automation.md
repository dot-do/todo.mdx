# Autonomous Development: Complete SDLC Automation

Enable AI agents to autonomously manage roadmaps, execute development tasks, and complete the full software development lifecycle without human intervention.

## Vision
AI agents can:
- Plan and break down roadmaps into tasks
- Execute code changes in sandboxed environments
- Run tests and verify changes
- Create PRs and handle reviews
- Deploy verified changes

## Current State (~50% complete)
- ✅ OAuth authentication
- ✅ GitHub webhooks and sync
- ✅ MCP tools for issue management
- ✅ Beads integration
- ❌ Sandbox execution (infrastructure exists, not wired)
- ❌ Unified issue registry
- ❌ Linear bidirectional sync
- ❌ Test/build automation
- ❌ PR automation in MCP
