# CLAUDE.md project structure missing several source files

The CLAUDE.md file lists the project structure under `src/` but is missing several source files that actually exist:

**Missing from documentation:**
- `src/patterns.ts` - Pattern system for filename generation
- `src/presets.ts` - Preset configurations  
- `src/templates.ts` - Template rendering and resolution

**Location:**
`/Users/nathanclevenger/projects/todo.mdx/CLAUDE.md` lines 72-91

This omission could lead to confusion for developers trying to understand the codebase structure.
