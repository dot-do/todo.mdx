# Add unit tests for packages (todo.mdx, roadmap.mdx)

Only 3 test files exist (all in agents.mdx). No tests for parsers, compilers, or renderers. High risk of regressions, hard to refactor safely. Add vitest tests targeting 80% coverage for core functionality.

### Timeline

- **Created:** 12/20/2025
- **Updated:** 12/21/2025
