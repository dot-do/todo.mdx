# Add Linear integration

Add Linear as an integration source alongside GitHub. Should support:
- OAuth connection to Linear workspace
- Two-way sync for issues (Linear issues <-> todo.mdx issues)
- Milestone mapping to Linear cycles/projects
- Label sync
- Status mapping (Linear states -> open/in_progress/closed)
