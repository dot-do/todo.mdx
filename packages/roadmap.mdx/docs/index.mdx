# roadmap.mdx

Write `ROADMAP.mdx` templates with live data, compile to `ROADMAP.md`, and sync with GitHub Milestones, Projects, and beads epics.

## Features

- **Milestone sync** - Sync GitHub Milestones with `.roadmap/*.md` files
- **Project sync** - Aggregate roadmaps across repos via GitHub Projects
- **Epic support** - Integrate with beads epics
- **Cross-repo** - Coordinate milestones across multiple repositories

## Quick Start

```bash
npx roadmap.mdx
```

This will:
1. Create `ROADMAP.mdx` if it doesn't exist
2. Compile to `ROADMAP.md` with live milestone/epic data

## How It Works

```
GitHub Milestones  ←→  TODO.mdx Worker  ←→  .roadmap/*.md files
GitHub Projects    ←→                   ←→  beads epics
```

The TODO.mdx GitHub App keeps everything in sync across repos.
