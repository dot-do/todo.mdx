# Auto Assign Workflow

This workflow automatically assigns issues to the claude agent when they become ready to work.

```typescript
// When an issue becomes ready (unblocked)
on.issue.ready(async (issue) => {
  // Update issue to in_progress and assign to claude
  await issues.update(issue.id, {
    status: 'in_progress',
    assignee: 'claude',
  })

  console.log(`Assigned ${issue.id} to claude`)
})
```
